FetchType        FetchMode          Result

LAZY             SELECT             Asked For Products - Queries - 2 select
                                    Not Asked For Products - Queries - 1 select


EAGER            SELECT             Asked For Products - Queries - 2 select
                                    Not Asked For Products - Queries - 2 select



LAZY             JOIN               Asked For Products - Queries - 1 join query
                                    Not Asked For Products - Queries - 1 join query



EAGER            JOIN               Asked For Products - Queries - 1 join query
                                    Not Asked For Products - Queries - 1 join query



LAZY             SUBSELECT           Asked For Products - Queries - 2 select queries
                                     Not Asked For Products - Queries - 1 select query



EAGER            SUBSELECT          Asked For Products - Queries - 2 select queries
                                    Not Asked For Products - Queries - 2 select queries

RESULTS ->

1. FetchMode is honored in case of SELECT in case of fetchtype EAGER, as we
saw select instead of joins

2. FetchMode Join will be dominant over any fetchtype.
It will get both Product and Category always

3. In case of SUB-SELECT, it is behaving same as SELECT. Unfortunately we are not able
to see any Subquery :(
